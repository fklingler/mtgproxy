![Build to Github Pages](https://github.com/fklingler/mtgproxy/workflows/Build%20to%20Github%20Pages/badge.svg?branch=master)

[A simple website](https://fklingler.github.io/mtgproxy) to make text proxies of your Magic: The Gathering cards.

It uses the amazing [Scryfall](https://www.scryfall.com) API.
Thanks to [Harubex](https://github.com/Harubex) and its [scryfall](https://github.com/Harubex/scryfall) project for the [types](https://github.com/Harubex/scryfall/tree/master/src).

It is inspired by the [proxygen project by Dryvnt](https://gitlab.com/Dryvnt/proxygen). The card templates are directly adapted from this project.
